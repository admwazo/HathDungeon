HathDungeon
===========

    Bravest (your_name_here)! You've accepted a most noble challenge,
although regrettably it may most certainly be your last. No matter,
far more valiant heroes have wandered into Hath Dungeon, never to
return. Face harrowing atrocities such as the 'Orc', 'Feral Cher', and
buckle your armor especially tight for the revloting, detestable,
abominable 'Windows XP'.

The enterprising warrior may find it advantageous to press the 'h'
key for help after entering the dungeon.
